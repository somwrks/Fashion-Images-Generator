# Fashion Images Generator (Generative Adversarial Neural Network)

This project focuses on implementing a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) for deep learning applications, specifically for analyzing various images and objects to generate new images or objects. The project is based on TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets, using a fashion MNIST dataset for training.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. `main.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the main codebase for building and training the GAN model.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow (version >= 2.x)
- TensorFlow Datasets
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Open and run the `main.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Follow the instructions and code comments within the notebook to train and evaluate the GAN model.

## Code Structure

The key components of the code include:

- Data preprocessing and loading using TensorFlow Datasets.
- Building the generator and discriminator models.
- Compiling the GAN model and defining the training process.
- Monitoring the training progress using custom callbacks.
- Saving and loading model weights for further use.

## Folder Structure

- `archive`: Contains saved model weights.
- `images`: Generated images during training.
